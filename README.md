# CaloriePredictor Machine Learning Project

This project consists in creating a machine learning algorithm to predict calorie expenditure in a workout session based on age, gender, body temperature during workout, heart rate intensity, workout duration, among other factors.

This is a work in progress and will be updated on a regular basis.

## Data preprocessing and training:

- For this project, I am using a Kaggle dataset composed of 2 CSV files: [![Kaggle Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CaloriePredictorDataset-orange?style=flat&logo=Kaggle&logoColor=white)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos?resource=download&select=exercise.csv)
- Jupyter Notebook has been used to load and preprocess the data, as well as train the model.
- Numpy and Pandas have been used for data preprocessing.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn were used for dataset visualization
- Finally, a XGBoost Regressor model was be used to train the model with good accuracy.

## Friendly user interface and model deployment:

- Streamlit will be used to build a user friendly interface where users can interact with the model.
- Docker will be used to create a container where the Streamlit app will be deployed.

Work in progress..
