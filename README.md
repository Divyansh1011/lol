# CaloriePredictor Machine Learning Project

A machine learning algorithm to predict calorie expenditure in a workout session based on body temperature, heart rate intensity, workout duration, among other factors.

This is a work in progress and will be updated on a regular basis.

For this project, I am using a Kaggle dataset composed of 2 CSV files:

I will be using numpy and pandas for data preprocessing.

An XGBoost model will be used to train the model.
